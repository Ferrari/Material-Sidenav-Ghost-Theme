# Material Sidenav Ghost

### Note

This theme is made for my personal blog, so the infomation there is mine. Please change it yourself! Also, I will keep updating but  I will not support for any issues.
Please feel free to edit this theme.

This theme is based on many frameworks: Bootstrap 3, Jasny Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap Material so it's not really light-weighted.
Animation isn't really good at all but I will fix it as soon as possible.

As I said, this theme is made for my blog, so the fonts there is for my language (Thai). If you want to change, it's ok but you have to change the font size as well!

### Installation

Download(clone) the respository, put it in ghost/content/themes.

Then restart your Ghost and select "Material Sidenav" .

Don't forget to enable "Public API" to make "Tag Cloud" works.

### Customization

There's 2 custom stylesheets, one is minified and one isn't. Minified version is quite hard to edit so you can edit the unminified version and miniy it later.
